#Steps explaining how the script works
- Set the working directory
- Prepared Training and Testing Dataset 
  - Read the data, label and subject using read.table function
  - Convert the label and subject to factors and Bind all the columns
- Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Column names are assigned to the dataset from the feature.txt file
- Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Assigned descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names
- Created independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
- created a text document of the independent tidy dataset
